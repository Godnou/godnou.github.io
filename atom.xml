    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a tutorial, this post shows a simple and extensible user material subroutine (UMAT), where large deformation is considered. For simplicity, the hypoelasticiy is adopted as the material law. The robustness and correctness of the general UMAT is demonstrated in two examples: one is uniaxial extention of a single element; the other is triaxial compression of a single element.</p><div class="figure"><figure class="figure"><img src="/imag/hypo.png"></figure></div><p>Caption: (a) uniaxial extension test of a single element (Force v.s. extention). (b) triaxial compression test of a single element (Volume strain v.s. compression). Both examples show the consistent results with one obtained by the built-in subroutine.</p><p>The source code can be found here: <a href="/files/hypoelasticity.for">Hypoelasticity</a></p><p>Detailed comments are added in the source code for explanation. The framework designed in the source code can be easily applied to other material laws, such as hyperelasticity, plasticity and viscoelasticity.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Computational multiscale multiphysics analysis of soft composites</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Computational multiscale multiphysics analysis of soft composites seems for me to be an interesting topic, where time-dependent material nonlinearity, large deformations, multiphysics coulping and multiscale information passing are accounted for. Out of my personal interest, a finite element package is developt. The project was started in Dec. 2018. It is now still under development. The so-called Nested finite element method(Nested FEM) is used in the calculation. Our calculation capability can demonstrate the effect of complex material heterogeneity ranging from different spatial scales. Herein, we use the dielectric elastomer composites (DECs) as an example(see the following figure).</p><div class="figure"><figure class="figure"><img src="/imag/NestFEM.png"></figure></div><p>Caption: (a) showing the initial configuration of a bulk DEC brick. (b) showing the deformed configuration of the DEC brick subject to an electric field. (c) showing the heterogenerous structure of the DEC brick, the dielectric permittivities are different in the red regions (inclusion) and the green region (matrix). (d) showing the profile of an intersection. (e) For a single phase material, Nested FEM (inset showing the unit cell) achieves a consistent solution with the analytical one. (f) For a two phase material, the dielectric permittivity of the inclusions is x#(#=1,2,4,6,8) times larger than the one of the matrix (inset showing the unit cell). The limit point, i.e, the largest voltage load, is decreased as the dielectric permittivity of the inclusions increases. Both Nested FEM and direct numerical simulation confirm the same result.</p><p>If one is also interested in this project, you are welcomed to join in developing the package.</p>]]></content>
